# RNPD-research-visualization-repo
Research and visualization lab for option-implied risk-neutral probability densities (RNPD), expected-value surfaces, and regime analysis using sanitized market data.
This repository explores the construction and visualization of option-implied risk-neutral probability densities (RNPD) and derived expected-value (EV) surfaces.
It is designed as a research and experimentation environment, focusing on probabilistic structure, surface behavior, and regime interpretation rather than live trading or execution.

All data used is sanitized or simulated. No trading strategies, execution logic, or proprietary signals are included.
